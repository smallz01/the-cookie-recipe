The Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie
By Alton Brown.

This is essentially a hack of the most famous cookie recipe in the world, which
we all know from the back of the Nestle “morsel” bag. Extra chewiness is attained
 by substituting bread flour for regular all purpose, replacing one egg white with
 milk, and changing the ratio of brown to white sugar.


Another note: Keep in mind this is a “chocolate chip” cookie and therefore the
quality of the final product will be greatly effected by the quality of the chips used.
Although the semi-sweet “morsels” that we all know from the yellow bag are
serviceable, I’d suggest combining such kid-friendly fodder with something a bit
more daring, say dark chocolate chips/chunks in the 68% cocoa range. Oh, and
remember you can chop your own.
Makes about 2 dozen cookies.
Active time: 20 minutes Total time: 1 hour 50 minutes Prep: 20 min Inactive: 1 hour Cook: 30 min

Cook’s Note The darker the sugar you use, the chewier your cookies will be.

Ingredients
16 Tbsp. (2 sticks) unsalted butter
12 oz. (2 1/2 cups) bread flour
1 tsp. kosher salt
1 tsp. baking soda
2 oz. (4 1/2 Tbsp.) granulated sugar 8 oz. (1 cup) light brown sugar 1 large egg 1 large egg yolk 1 oz. (2 Tbsp.) whole milk 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract 12 oz. chocolate chips

Directions
Melt the butter in a 2-quart saucepan over low heat, then set aside to cool slightly.
Sift together the flour, salt and baking soda onto a paper plate.
Pour the butter into your stand mixer’s work bowl. Add the sugars and beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed for 2 minutes.
Meanwhile in a separate bowl, whisk together the whole egg, egg yolk, milk and vanilla extract.
Slow the mixer to “stir” and slowly work the egg mixture into the butter and sugar. Mix until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds
Using the paper plate as a slide, gradually integrate the dry ingredients, stopping a couple of times to scrape down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula
Once the flour is worked in, drop the speed to “stir” and add the chocolate chips.
Chill the dough for 1 hour.
Heat the oven to 375 degrees F and place the racks in the top third and bottom third of the oven.
Scoop the dough into 1 1/2-ounce portions onto parchment paper-line half sheet pans, 6 cookies per sheet.
Bake two sheets at a time for 15 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through.
Remove from the oven, slide the parchment with the cookies onto a cooling rack, and wait at least 5 minutes before devouring. Makes approximately 2 dozen cookies

Alton Brown is a foodie phenomenon: a great cook, a very funny guy, and—underneath
it all—a science geek who’s as interested in the chemistry of cooking as he is in eating. (Well, almost.)
