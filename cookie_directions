<ul>
<li>Melt the butter in a 2-quart saucepan over low heat, then set aside to cool slightly.</li>

<li>Sift together the flour, salt and baking soda onto a paper plate.</li>

<li>Pour the butter into your stand mixer’s work bowl.</li>

<li>Add the sugars and beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed for 2 minutes.</li>

<li>Meanwhile in a separate bowl, whisk together the whole egg, egg yolk, milk and vanilla extract.</li>

<li>Slow the mixer to “stir” and slowly work the egg mixture into the butter and sugar.</li>

<li>Mix until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds</li>

<li>Using the paper plate as a slide, gradually integrate the dry ingredients, stopping
a couple of times to scrape down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula</li>

<li>Once the flour is worked in, drop the speed to “stir” and add the chocolate chips.</li>

<li>Chill the dough for 1 hour.</li>

<li>Heat the oven to 375 degrees F and place the racks in the top third and bottom
third of the oven.</li>

<li>Scoop the dough into 1 1/2-ounce portions onto parchment paper-line half sheet pans,
6 cookies per sheet.</li>

<li>Bake two sheets at a time for 15 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through.</li>

<li>Remove from the oven, slide the parchment with the cookies onto a cooling rack, and
wait at least 5 minutes before devouring.</li>
</ul>
